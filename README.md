# AraratMorse

This project is a web application for Morse code translation, developed using Blazor and the [MorseSharp](https://github.com/p6laris/MorseSharp/tree/master) C# library. It provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding text into Morse code, generating audio representations of Morse code signals, and visualizing Morse code signals as flashing light patterns.
